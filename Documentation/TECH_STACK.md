Backend Technology Stack
Core Technologies
Node.js
Why we chose it:
Node.js is a fast, lightweight, and event-driven runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. Since it uses non-blocking I/O, it’s ideal for building high-performance web applications that need to handle many simultaneous connections.

What makes it a good choice:

Runs JavaScript on the backend, which means we can use one language across the entire stack no context switching for developers

Has a massive open-source ecosystem through npm, with libraries for almost anything we need

Performs well under load and scales easily, especially in microservices environments

Backed by a large and active community, making it easy to find help, tools, and best practices

Express.js
Why we chose it:
Express is a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework that doesn’t enforce a strict structure, which gives us more control over how we design our backend.

What makes it a good choice:

Easy to set up and customize to suit our application’s needs

Huge middleware ecosystem we can plug in authentication, error handling, logging, and more without reinventing the wheel

Clean and intuitive routing system, which makes managing API endpoints simple

Widely adopted and well-documented, so onboarding new developers is easier

Sequelize
Why we chose it:
Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js that simplifies database interaction while still allowing flexibility when needed.

What makes it a good choice:

Works with multiple databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite) with minimal changes to our code

Built-in migration system lets us version-control our database schema easily

Provides strong model-level validation to protect data integrity

Makes managing relationships between models (like one-to-many or many-to-many) straightforward

The query builder helps reduce the risk of SQL injection and improves readability

NeonDB
Why we chose it:
NeonDB is a modern, serverless PostgreSQL platform designed for developers. It’s scalable, easy to use, and cost-effective — perfect for our use case.

What makes it a good choice:

Automatically handles scaling, so we don’t need to worry about infrastructure

Lets us create “branches” of the database, which is great for testing new features or development without affecting production

Pay-as-you-go pricing model keeps costs low during development and scales with our app

Offers fast performance with built-in connection pooling and caching

Web-based UI is intuitive and developer-friendly

Swagger (OpenAPI)
Why we chose it:
Swagger helps us document our APIs in a way that’s both human- and machine-readable, making collaboration and testing much smoother.

What makes it a good choice:

Automatically generates interactive, live documentation so we can test endpoints directly from the browser

Follows OpenAPI 3.0 standards, which means it’s compatible with a wide range of tools

Enables auto-generation of client SDKs in different languages

Great for internal team alignment and onboarding developers

Speeds up testing and reduces miscommunication between frontend and backend

Cloudinary
Why we chose it:
Managing images and videos manually can be a headache. Cloudinary simplifies everything from uploads and storage to transformations and delivery.

What makes it a good choice:

Handles image uploads,pdf uploads, compression, resizing, and delivery through a single API

Automatically optimizes media for web and mobile performance

Provides secure and reliable cloud storage

Makes it easy to transform and manipulate media with URL-based parameters (e.g., cropping, blurring, adding overlays)

Reduces backend storage complexity and lets us focus on building features
