Backend Technology Stack
Core Technologies
Node.js

Why we chose it:
Node.js is a fast, lightweight, and event-driven runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. With its non-blocking I/O model, it’s perfect for building high-performance applications that need to handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently.

What makes it a good choice (compared to alternatives):

✅ Single language across stack: Run JavaScript on both frontend and backend (unlike Django [Python] or Spring Boot [Java], which introduce extra context switching).

✅ Massive npm ecosystem: 2M+ packages — far larger than most other backends (Deno and Bun are newer and have smaller ecosystems).

✅ Performance & scalability: Great for microservices and real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, notifications), where PHP or Ruby may struggle under heavy load.

✅ Thriving community: Backed by big tech (e.g., Netflix, PayPal, Uber use Node.js).

Express.js

Why we chose it:
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js framework that gives us control without enforcing strict patterns.

What makes it a good choice (compared to alternatives):

✅ Lightweight & flexible: Unlike frameworks like NestJS or AdonisJS, Express doesn’t lock us into rigid structures.

✅ Huge middleware ecosystem: Authentication, logging, error handling, and more available out-of-the-box.

✅ Simple routing: Clean and intuitive API endpoint management.

✅ Battle-tested: Used in production by companies like Uber and IBM.

Sequelize (ORM)

Why we chose it:
Sequelize is a promise-based ORM that simplifies database interactions while giving us flexibility.

What makes it a good choice (compared to alternatives):

✅ Database agnostic: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite — unlike Prisma, which is newer and less mature in some features.

✅ Migrations built-in: Database schema versioning is simple and reliable.

✅ Strong validation & associations: Easy handling of one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.

✅ Readable query builder: Safer and cleaner than raw SQL (minimizes injection risks).

NeonDB (PostgreSQL)

Why we chose it:
NeonDB is a modern, serverless PostgreSQL platform — developer-friendly, scalable, and cost-effective.

What makes it a good choice (compared to alternatives):

✅ Serverless scaling: Unlike AWS RDS or GCP Cloud SQL, Neon automatically scales connections and compute.

✅ Branching feature: Create database “branches” for staging/testing — similar to Git, but for databases.

✅ Cost-effective: Pay-as-you-go model vs expensive traditional managed databases.

✅ Performance built-in: Connection pooling and caching reduce latency.

✅ Modern UX: Cleaner developer dashboard than ElephantSQL or Supabase (for pure Postgres use).

Swagger (OpenAPI)

Why we chose it:
Swagger simplifies API documentation and testing while ensuring consistency with OpenAPI standards.

What makes it a good choice (compared to alternatives):

✅ Interactive live docs: Test endpoints directly from browser (unlike Postman collections that aren’t auto-updated).

✅ OpenAPI 3.0 compatible: Works seamlessly with modern API tooling.

✅ Generates SDKs automatically: Save dev time by creating client libraries.

✅ Improves collaboration: Reduces friction between backend and frontend teams.

Cloudinary

Why we chose it:
Cloudinary makes managing images, videos, and PDFs easy — from uploads to optimization and delivery.

What makes it a good choice (compared to alternatives):

✅ All-in-one media solution: Upload, store, transform, optimize — unlike AWS S3 (storage only) or Imgix (delivery only).

✅ Performance-focused: Auto-optimizes media for web & mobile.

✅ URL-based transformations: Quick edits (resize, crop, blur, watermark) without code-heavy pipelines.

✅ Reduces backend complexity: Frees us from writing custom file handling logic.

✅ Trusted by top brands: Used by big names like Lyft, Vogue, and BuzzFeed.

👉 Together, this stack is fast, scalable, cost-efficient, and developer-friendly, while reducing friction compared to alternatives like Django (Python), Laravel (PHP), or Ruby on Rails.
